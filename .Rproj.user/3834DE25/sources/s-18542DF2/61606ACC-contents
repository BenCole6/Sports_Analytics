# Abstract

# Introduction

The National Hockey League (hereon NHL) is the North American ice hockey competition held each year across the winter months of the Northern hemisphere. The regular season begins in October and usually ends in April the following year, with the finals playoffs series culminating in the competition for the coveted Stanley Cup usually in June. (NHL, 2019)    

## St. Louis Blues - Underdogs

The St. Louis Blues were the winners of the 2018-2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, winning a 4-3 series against the Boston Bruins. The Blues winning the Stanley Cup was paticularly extraordinary not only because it was the first in their history as a club in the NHL, but also because they faced off against the Bruins have appeared so regularly in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Since joining the NHL in 1967, the St Louis Blues have contested the Stanley Cup Playoffs only 4 times, whilst the Boston Bruins have made it to the Cup Playoffs 10 times since 1967 (and a total 20 since joining the NHL in 1924). (NHL, 2019)  

What arguably made the St. Louis Blues appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals most incredible was that they ranked last in January of the same season. Sometime between January and April they managed to claw their way to clinching a playoffs appearance. (Bardown, 2019)

## NHL Season and Post-Season Structure

The NHL contained a total of 31 teams in the 2019 season. These 31 teams were split across two conferences, Eastern and Western. Each conference comprised two divisions each; Metropolitan and Atlantic in the Eastern Conference and Central and Pacific in the Western Conference. (NHL, 2019)    

Throughout the regular season each team will play 82 games, which are a mixture of home and away fixtures. As the playing season is approximately 27 weeks, these 82 games average out to be more than three games per week. Therefore, unlike many Australian sporting codes, there are no "rounds" in the NHL but simply game numbers. Further, there is no structure or restriction to which game each team is playing. For example, one team may be playing their 26th game against an opponent that is playing their 23rd. (NHL, 2019)  
If a team wins a game in the regular season they are awarded 2 points for the win. If the game has a tied scoreline at the end of the third 20-minute period it will go into overtime. If the scoreline is still tied at the end of two overtime periods then a shootout is played until a winner is decided. The team that wins by any method, including overtime or shootout, is still awarded 2 points. The team that loses in overtime or shootout is awarded one point. If the game is decided before overtime the losing team will be awarded 0 points. (MacDonald, R, 2018)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

season_points <- tibble("Win Type" = c("Not Overtime",
                                       "Overtime or Shootout"),
                        "Winning Team Points" = c(2,2),
                        "Losing Team Points" = c(0,1))

kable_styling(kable(season_points,
                    caption = "Points awarded for different win types in NHL regular season"),
              bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
              full_width = F)

```

Once the regular season has finished and team standings have been calculated a bracketed finals system is drawn up for the playoffs. The finals playoffs follow a repeating knockout structure that has 3 rounds before reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs. Each conference follows the same structure, so only one will be described as follows:  

### Playoffs Selection

A total of 16 teams from both conferences qualify for the finals playoffs. The top three teams in each division are awarded spots in the playoffs. As there are two divisions in each conference, this results in 6 teams in each conference making it to the finals. A further two spots are awarded to the next two highest ranking teams in the conference that did not make the playoffs. As this is based on standings in the conference overall, it's possible for a division to send two wildcards through to the playoffs.

#### First Round

In the first round the highest-ranked division winner plays the lowest-ranked wildcard entrant. The lesser-ranked division winner then plays the remaining wildcard entrant. Teams ranked second and third within each division play each other. Each pairing is decided by a series of games which is decided when one team wins 4 times. This results in a series length that can be anywhere between 4 (winning 4-0) and 7 (winning 4-3), or the best of 7 games.

#### Second Round

The winners of each of each First Round series then play each other in the second round, keeping within divisions and ignoring wildcards. Again, a best of 7 series is played in each pairing.

#### Conference Round

The winners of each Second Round series face off in the Conference round, which decides the winner of each conference via a best of 7 games series.

#### Stanley Cup

The winners of each Conference Round series play off in the Stanley Cup finals, which are also a best of 7 series.

# Aim

## Research Question

Considering the turn around in the St. Louis Blues' performance within the season and the lengthy multiple finals series, what were the chances that the St. Louis Blues could win the Stanley Cup from their standings at the end of the regular season? Further, did this chance considerably from their standings at the end of their 25th and 50th games?

## Overview of Methods

To answer the above questions, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to simulate the season based on Elo ratings at different points in time. These partitions in the data were set at 25 games, 50 games, and the end of the regular season of 82 games.

# Literature Review

## Elo Rating Models

### Predictive Model Overview

Elo Models have a long history for rating teams and players in sport. The first application for Elo models was in rating chess players as applied in the text "*The rating of chessplayers, past and present*" written by Arpad Elo (Elo, 1978). A relatively simple model, it takes the "strength" of each competitor and creates an expected probability of the team winning. The probability domain ranges between 0 and 1, and so by extension the competitor's probability of winning is $ 1-E_A$. Elo models can either be adaptive to be used as a season progresses or can be constant based on game results of historical data. The constant Elo method for rating teams uses optimisation methods to minimise errors when predicting results of past matches.    

### Past Applications

Elo ratings have had a range of applications in sports ratings, with one example being Hvattum, L.M. and Arntzen, H. (2010) applying it association football (soccer). In their paper they applied a variable Elo rating system that incorporated a home ground advantage. They used this variable Elo rating method in logit regression models, which were then used to place hypothetical bets. After evaluation and benchmarking against other methods, they found the models based on Elo ratings to perform better than all other models. The only exceptions to this were models based on betting market information. Further,r they found the variable Elo rating methods to be significant predictors of actual game results, which further solidifies their applications outside of academia.

Ryall, R. and Bedford, A. (2010) also applied optimised Elo ratings models to another sporting code: Australian Rules Football (AFL). Their addition to the model examined home ground advantage of each game, if present. The home ground advantage was incorporated into the Elo prediction model by way of stacking the rating of a home team higher for when they were playing to a home ground advantage. They found adding a home ground advantage did not improve the Elo rating system as compared to previous work by Stefani and Clarke (1992), but cited the low variation in team premiership points as a potentially confounding factor.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

### Overview

Monte Carlo simulations are simple in their structure, which lends them to large iteration chains. A random number generator is used to generate a number between a defined interval, usually $(0<x<1)$. This number is then compared to an expected value. If the expected value is binary, say a coin flip, any number lesser than 0.5 is rounded to 0 and any number greater than or equal to 0.5 is rounded to 1. The distribution of the random number generator can also be chosen, and a uniform distribution with equal probability between any given points in the interval is most common. This process is repeated several times to simulate thousands of observations. (Theodore & Prochaska, 2018)

# Methods

## Optimised Elo Ratings

A constant Elo rating method was used in this study. To determine the optimised Elo ratings of each team in the NHL, the below formula was used to estimate the expected results of each game.

$$ E_A = \frac{1}{1+10^{\left(- \left(\frac{\left(Rating_A - Rating_B \right)}{\delta} \right) \right)}} $$

For each given game, the errors were calculated between the Expected result and the actual result of the match. Different ratings for each team were optimised by minimising the sum of the squares of the errors. The only constraints on the optimisation were that the team ratings averaged 1500 so as to allow for $ \delta=400$.

## Data Partitions

Data was partitioned at three points:
1. Matches where both teams played no more than 25 games
2. Matches where both teams played no more than 50 games
3. No partition, so where teams had played no more than the full 82 games of the season

The first partition was based on the ladder position of the St. Louis Blues after that game number; their lowest point in the season and ranked 30 out of total 31 teams in the League.  
The second partition was chosen arbitrarily. The rationale was for the partition to be twice as many games as the first partition and approximately 2/3^{rds} of the regular season.  
The last partition, or no partition at all, was chosen to examine the St. Louis Blues' chances of winning the Stanley Cup after their final standing in the season.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

### Regular Season

During the regular seasons for partitions 25 and 50, games from 26 and 51 onwards (respectively) were simulated using Monte Carlo methods. A uniform distribution between 0 and 1 was used and compared to the expected results. If the expected result, from Team A's perspective, was greater than the random number a win was recorded, with the winning team earning 2 points to their standings. If the expected result was lesser than the random number by no more than 5 percent, an overtime loss was recorded for Team A and they were awarded 1 point. If the expected result was more than 5% lesser than the random number, a regular loss was recorded and Team A awarded 0 points to their standings.


$$ Points_{A\ |\ \left(E_A > RNG \right)}=2 $$

$$ Points_{A\ |\ \left(E_A < \left(RNG \times 0.95\right) \right)}=0 $$

$$ Points_{A\ |\ \left(\left(E_A < RNG \right)\ \&\ E_A > \left(RNG \times 0.95 \right) \right)}=1 $$

### Finals Playoffs

The above points system using overtime losses was not used in each stage of the finals playoffs. The model was simplified to only compare the expected results to the random number, and any expected result greater than the random number was recorded as a win to Team A.

$$ Points_{A\ |\ E_A<RNG}=1 $$
$$ Points_B = 1- Points_A $$

The first team to reach 4 wins proceeded to the next round per the finals structure outlined in section 2.2.1 above. This was repeated for each stage in the finals playoffs including the final round, the Stanley Cup playoffs, where the first team to 4 wins was also simulated to be the champion of that iteration in the simulation.  

### Monte Carlo Simulations on Partitioned Data

#### Partitions 25 and 50

The Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the data partitions at games 25 and 50. All games in the regular season were simulated after the partition using constant Elo ratings from games prior to the partition. That is, games 26 to 82 were simulated using Elo ratings optimised on games 1 to 25, and games 51 to 82 were simulated using Elo ratings optimised on games 1 to 50.

#### No Partition: 82 Games

The final simulation did not simulate matches in the regular season but *only* simulated games in the post-season playoffs using Elo ratings optimised on match results for games 1 to 82.
